## Java Certification

Source - https://education.oracle.com/education/pdf/JavaCertificationMap.pdf

The Oracle Certification track now consists of levels 
â€“ Associate (OCA)
- Professional (OCP)
- Master (OCM)
- & a few others - Talk about complexity

### Java 8
- Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE 8 Programmer	1Z0-808
- Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 8 Programmer II, 1Z0-809
- You have other upgrade options from earlier versions
- There is NO Oracle Certified Master for Java SE 8
  - The last master certification for Java - Oracle Certified Master, Java SE 6 Developer 1Z0-855 (includes an assignment and an essay) - is discontinued
     	- The Oracle Certified Master, Java SE 6 Developer certification retires on November 30, 2016.
     	- At this time, there is no plan to release a new version of the certification. Through careful job task analysis with the Java SE 8 certification release, it was determined that the OCM Developer role was no longer appropriate to keep as a separate certification and the that skills of that role should be included in the Programmer certifications.

## Upgrade to Java SE 8 OCP ( Java SE 6 and all prior versions)

Section 1: Declarations, Initialization and Scoping

- Develop code that declares an interface. Develop code that implements or extends one or more interfaces.
- Develop code that declares an abstract class. Develop code that extends an abstract class.
- Develop code that declares, initializes, and uses primitives, arrays, enums, and objects as static, instance, and local variables. Also, use legal identifiers for variable names.
- Given a code example, determine if a method is correctly overriding or overloading another method, and identify legal return values (including covariant returns), for the method.
- Given a set of classes and superclasses, develop constructors for one or more of the classes. Given a class declaration, determine if a default constructor will be created, and if so, determine the behavior of that constructor. Given a nested or non-nested class listing, write code to instantiate the class.

Section 2: Flow Control

- Develop code that implements an if or switch statement; and identify legal argument types for these statements.
- Develop code that implements all forms of loops and iterators, including the use of for, the enhanced for loop (for-each), do, while, labels, break, and continue; and explain the values taken by loop counter variables during and after loop execution.

- Develop code that makes use of exceptions and exception handling clauses (try, catch, finally), and declares methods and overriding methods that throw exceptions.
- Recognize the effect of an exception arising at a specified point in a code fragment. Note that the exception may be a runtime exception, a checked exception, or an error.
- Recognize situations that will result in any of the following being thrown: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,ClassCastException, IllegalArgumentException, IllegalStateException, NullPointerException, NumberFormatException, AssertionError, ExceptionInInitializerError, StackOverflowError or NoClassDefFoundError. Understand which of these are thrown by the virtual machine and recognize situations in which others should be thrown programatically.

Section 3: API Contents

- Develop code that uses the primitive wrapper classes (such as Boolean, Character, Double, Integer, etc.), and/or autoboxing & unboxing. Discuss the differences between the String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer classes.
- Given a scenario involving navigating file systems, reading from files, writing to files, or interacting with the user, develop the correct solution using the following classes (sometimes in combination), from java.io: BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, File, FileReader, FileWriter, PrintWriter, and Console.

(dot), * (star), + (plus), ?, \d, \s, \w, [], ()). The use of *, +, and ? will be limited to greedy quantifiers, and the parenthesis operator will only be used as a grouping mechanism, not for capturing content during matching.

Use capabilities in the java.util package to write code to manipulate an array by sorting, performing a binary search, or converting the array to a list. Use the java.util.Comparator and java.lang.Comparable interfaces to affect the sorting of lists and arrays. Furthermore, recognize the effect of the "natural ordering" of primitive wrapper classes and java.lang.String on sorting.
